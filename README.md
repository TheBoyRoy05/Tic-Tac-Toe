# Tic-Tac-Toe with TIME TRAVEL!!

This is a fun little game that I created after learning the basics of React. The idea behind the game is to save all the past states of the Tic-Tac-Toe board and make them accessible to the players so they can "go back in time" and fix their past mistakes. You can find the game [here](https://theboyroy05.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/) and here's a little preview:
