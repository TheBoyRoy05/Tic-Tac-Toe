# Tic-Tac-Toe with TIME TRAVEL!!

Play [Tic-Tac-Toe with Time Travel](https://theboyroy05.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/) here.

This is a fun little game that I created after learning the basics of React. The idea behind the game is to save all the past states of the Tic-Tac-Toe board and make them accessible to the players so they can "go back in time" and fix their past mistakes. Here's a preview of the game:
